                <p><b>Overall Employment Numbers in Canada</b><br>
                    In 2023, the labour force in Canada totaled 21,325,800 individuals. With a total population of 40,769,890, 
                    including children and seniors, this means that slightly more than half of the population is actively 
                    participating in the labour market.</p>
    
                <p><b>Unemployment Rate Over TIme</b><br>
                    The unemployment rate in Canada has fluctuated significantly over the years, influenced by various external 
                    factors. The rate reached its peak in 2020 at 9.7% due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, 
                    it declined sharply by 2022, reaching the lowest point in recent years. From taking a closer look at full-time 
                    employment by industry, particularly in accommodation and food services, it helps explain the spike in unemployment 
                    during 2020. These sectors were among the hardest hit by the pandemic. Additionally, the accommodation and food 
                    services industry stands out as the only sector where the number of workers aged 15 to 24 exceeded that of those 
                    aged 55 above.</p>
    
                <p><b>Gender Differences</b><br>
                    In August 2024, there’s approximately 46.83% of women employed in Canada. The age group of 30 to 34 years has the 
                    highest number of females in the workforce. Interestingly, the same age group also has the highest number of males 
                    employed. </p>
    
                <p><b>Average Weekly Earnings</b><br>
                    The average weekly earnings across various industries and regions have fluctuated over time. As of August 2024, the 
                    Northwest Territories continue to have the highest average weekly earnings across industries, while Prince Edward 
                    Island has the lowest. However, Prince Edward Island recently raised its minimum wage from $15 to $16 in October 2024, 
                    surpassing Nova Scotia, which is ranked just above it. This change could lead to shifts in rankings over time, 
                    particularly as the new minimum wage takes effect. </p>
    
                    <p>It’s important to note that while the minimum wage plays a role in shaping overall earnings, it doesn’t necessarily 
                    justify the rankings of average weekly earnings across provinces and territories. For example, Alberta and Saskatchewan 
                    have the lowest minimum wages in August 2024, but their rankings for average weekly earnings are third and ninth 
                    respectively. Alberta, despite having the same minimum wage since 2020, maintains the third highest average weekly 
                    earnings overall. On the other hand, Nunavut, which has the highest minimum wage in 2024 at $19, ranks second in average 
                    weekly earnings. This suggests that a significant portion of the workforce in Nunavut may be earning at or near the 
                    minimum wage. </p>
    
                    <p>According to Matt Jones, Alberta’s Minister of Jobs, Economy and Trade, the province should be considered a unique case 
                    within Canada due to its low provincial income tax rates, high personal income tax exemption levels, and the absence of 
                    a provincial sales tax. However, this creates challenges for lower-income Albertans. Compared to other provinces, Alberta's 
                    first tax bracket is set at 10% on income up to $148,269, which is particularly burdensome for those earning minimum wage. 
                    In contrast, higher earners benefit from a lower rate of 15% on income exceeding $355,845, a system that appears to favor 
                    wealthier individuals. For example, in British Columbia, the provincial income tax rate is 20,5% on income over $252,752.</p>
    
                    <p>Canada has 9.798%, on average, of the population who is a daily smoker, smoking at least one cigarette a day. New Brunswick 
                    has the highest percentage of smokers, and this can be correlated with the percentage of mental health as New Brunswick 
                    reports the second lowest percentage of individuals with healthy mental health. A study examining perceived stress and 
                    smoking across 41 countries found that there is a strong positive relationship between stress and smoking. In high-income 
                    countries, those with higher stress tend to have stronger cravings for nicotine, which leads to regular smoking. Thus, with 
                    higher stress provinces like New Brunswick, individuals will find it challenging to resist smoking.</p>
    
                <p><b>Employment Trends Over TIme</b><br>
                    As the population of Canada continues to grow, it follows that the number of people employed full-time will also rise. From 
                    2010 to 2019, full-time employment steadily increased. However, from 2019 to 2020, there was a short-term decline, likely due 
                    to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. After the brief drop, the number of full-time workers surged again, especially among 
                    individuals between 25 to 54 years old across all industries. </p>

                    <P>One particularly interesting trend is observed in the fishing, hunting, and trapping industry. This industry has no workers 
                        in the 15 to 24 age group, and over time, it has shown a decline in popularity. Additionally, the workforce in this sector 
                        is aging, with fewer workers in the 25 to 54 age group and a rise in the number of workers aged 55 and older. In contrast, 
                        most other industries, such as forestry, logging, and agriculture, show a general upward trend in employment.</P>

                <p><b>Education and Gender for Full-Time Employments</b><br>
                    After completing a diploma, both males and females show a higher probability of being employed full-time. However, men, in 
                    particular, have the highest percentage of full-time employment with a bachelor’s degree. For women, the highest percentage of 
                    full-time employment is seen among those who hold a degree higher than a bachelor’s degree. After completing a diploma, including 
                    apprenticeships or trades certificates, the percentage of full-time employment for women increases to above 60%. On average, across 
                    various industries, a higher proportion of males are employed full-time compared to females.</p>

                <p><b>Industry Employment Trends</b><br>
                <P>In 2023, the healthcare and social assistance industry employed approximately 2,131,000 people, making it one of the largest 
                    sectors in Canada. This is followed by the manufacturing industry and the professional, scientific, and technical services industry.
                    When observing full-time employment by industry, it’s clear that the healthcare industry is one of the fastest-growing sectors. It 
                    has remained relatively stable during external disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic, showing consistent growth. On the other hand, 
                    the manufacturing industry has experienced a decline in the number of workers aged 15 to 24, coupled with a rise in workers aged 55 
                    and older. This suggests that the manufacturing workforce is aging, with fewer younger workers entering the sector.</P>
                    
                    <p>Industries such as professional, scientific, and technical services are becoming increasingly dominant among workers aged 25 to 54, 
                    similarly to healthcare. Like healthcare, these industries have also been less impacted by external factors such as COVID-19, showing 
                    resilience and growth. However, there is a clear difference in the percentage of males and females employed in certain industries. 
                    In healthcare and social assistance and educational services, it is clear that there are more females employed than males. However, 
                    in other industries like manufacturing, construction, and durables, there are more males employed than females. </P>
                    
                <p><b>Conclusion</b><br>
                
                <p>In conclusion, the labour force in Canada has experienced notable changes in recent years, shaped by factors such as the COVID-19 
                    pandemic, demographic trends, and changes in employment patterns across various industries. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, 
                    the Canadian labour market has shown resilience with full-time employment surging once again, particularly among individuals aged 25 to 54. 
                    Key sectors such as healthcare, social assistance, and professional services have seen consistent growth while industries like fishing, 
                    hunting, and manufacturing are struggling with an aging workforce and fewer younger workers entering the field. </p>

                    </p>The fluctuations in average weekly earnings across provinces reflect the complex relationship between minimum wage levels and overall 
                    income, with some regions maintaining high earnings despite relatively low minimum wages. Additionally, the gender divide in full-time 
                    employment across different industries highlights opening disparities in employment opportunities and industry preferences.</p>
