                <p><b>Health expenditure and financing</b><br>
                    Canada's healthcare spending, converted to USD, is aligned with the OECD average. However, excluding the U.S. 
                    (an outlier due to its significantly higher healthcare spending), Canada spends more than most other countries. 
                    As a percentage of the GDP, Canada ranks among the top healthcare spenders, alongside the U.S, France, Germany, 
                    and Switzerland. Apart from the time period during COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare spending in Canada has remained 
                    relatively stable with a slight upward trend.</p>
    
                <p><b>Healthcare Coverage</b><br>
                    Canada provides mandatory government healthcare through provincial and territorial health insurance plans, 
                    covering medically necessary services. However, the Canada Health Act does not specifically define what is deemed 
                    'medically necessary,' leading to situations where some individuals or families who are not eligible for publicly 
                    funded coverage choose to pay for supplemental medical services. According to the OECD’s definition of voluntary 
                    health insurance (VHI), 10% of this coverage comes from individual policies, while the remaining 90% is from 
                    group plans. Employers are obligated to provide employment insurance, which can include health coverage, and 
                    therefore counted towards VHI. As a result, Canada has one of the highest percentages of voluntary health 
                    insurance, with 69% of the population despite having 100% of government/compulsory health insurance.</p>
    
                <p>On the other hand, the U.K. has the National Health Service (NHS) for universal coverage and is free. It has a 
                    low voluntary health insurance of 10.9% because these are families who opted to receive earlier hospital attention 
                    or undergo operations in private hospitals at a time more suitable than the availability under the NHS. However, 
                    we also have countries like the U.S.A. where the population who have government/compulsory health insurance is less 
                    than those who have voluntary health insurance. This is because the eligibility of government insurance differs for 
                    each individual. Compulsory health insurance is only available to certain groups such as those aged 65 years old and 
                    over or other certain vulnerable groups.</p>
    
                <p><b>Perceived Health Status</b>
                    <br>Canada maintains a relatively high health satisfaction rate across income and education levels, whereas in countries 
                    like the U.S., satisfaction drops significantly for lower-income groups. Universal healthcare might be one of the factors 
                    that plays a role in health across socio-economic backgrounds.</p>
    
                <p><b>Health Indicators</b><br>
                    The average life expectancy in Canada at birth is 81.34 years old and it is showing a downward trend. The provinces 
                    with larger populations have a higher life expectancy than the provinces with smaller populations. According to the 
                    study Associations between Urban Sprawl and Life Expectancy in the United States, more compact, densely populated areas 
                    tend to have higher life expectancy. The study suggests that this may be that dispersed populations, such as rural areas, 
                    makes it difficult to establish health care facilities and provide options for healthy foods.</p>
    
                <p>Canada’s rate of overweight, BMI of over 25, don’t differ among the provinces. On average for all age groups, 34.64% of 
                    the population is overweight. The percentage of overweight individuals increases with age with larger increases from 18 
                    to 34 years old and 35 to 49 years old.</p>
    
                <p>On average, half of Canada reported to have very good or excellent mental health with more population in Quebec reporting 
                    better mental health condition. So far, Quebec is the province with better life expectancy, physical well-being and healthy 
                    mental health. However, it has the lowest percentage of the population with influenza immunization. Based on the HEC Montreal 
                    report, those residing in Quebec have doubts on the effectiveness of influenza vaccines because of its volatile nature. They 
                    also underestimate the consequences of influenza and only those who are more vulnerable to the virus tend to get vaccinated. 
                    This might be an expected outcome because Quebec used to have a restricted flu vaccination program, catering to individuals 
                    aged 65 years and older, those with chronic illness, residents of long-term care facilities, and healthcare workers. Until 
                    recently, in 2022, the flu vaccination was made available to everyone.</p>
    
                <p>Canada has 9.798%, on average, of the population who is a daily smoker, smoking at least one cigarette a day. New Brunswick 
                    has the highest percentage of smokers, and this can be correlated with the percentage of mental health as New Brunswick 
                    reports the second lowest percentage of individuals with healthy mental health. A study examining perceived stress and 
                    smoking across 41 countries found that there is a strong positive relationship between stress and smoking. In high-income 
                    countries, those with higher stress tend to have stronger cravings for nicotine, which leads to regular smoking. Thus, with 
                    higher stress provinces like New Brunswick, individuals will find it challenging to resist smoking.</p>
    
                <p><b>Conclusion</b><br>
                    Canada is one of the top healthcare spenders among OECD countries with a system dependent on universal government-provided 
                    insurance and high levels of voluntary health insurance. While healthcare access is widespread, there are variations in 
                    health outcomes across provinces, influenced by other factors, partly due to the flexibility in defining ‘medically necessary’ 
                    services under the Canada Health Act for provinces and territories. For instance, Quebec has better mental health and life 
                    expectancy, but faced challenges in persuading individuals to take influenza immunization due to historical restrictions on 
                    vaccine coverage. On the other hand, high smoking provinces like New Brunswick show a strong correlation between higher stress 
                    and lifestyle choices. These disparities emphasize a need for ongoing attention to healthcare policies to ensure equitable 
                    health outcomes across Canada.</p>
